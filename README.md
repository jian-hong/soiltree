Hi, I am the only member from the team, SOILTREE.  
I am a CNC engineering assistant working for a manufacturing company. 
The past decade has been onerous to global humanity. 
The COVID-19 pandemic and triple global crisis undermine decades of global progress. 
Nevertheless, these events drew global attention to the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as mine. 
We have learned over the years that deforestation is inevitable. We require wood for a variety of purposes, including home furnishings, paper production, and fuel. 
Annually, timber deforestation generated approximately $500 million in economic value. 
Nonetheless, we cannot deny that timber trees also produced 67 million tonnes of Oxygen annually and we know that Oxygen is essential as the human body's fuel. 
Since we cannot alter the fate of trees being cut down, we can plant fast growing and economical timber on the right soil. 
Here comes the problem, which species of the timbers should be planted based on the soil. 
Let me introduce, the timber guide system powered by SOILTREE.
 
These are a few rapidly growing trees with their fertile soil conditions. 
First, we will calculate the mean pH and organic matter concentrations. 
Then, we can classify them more easily for machine processing. 
Next, we obtained a soil sample with random soil characteristics. 
Here is our solution: we classified the soil based on its pH, salinity, and organic content. 
If they matched the attribute of a particular tree, it would be suggested.

 
All of them matched the dominant species at the region we collected the soil.
 
This project's success allows us to cultivate the best trees on the most suitable soils. 
We believe it can annually double the economic benefits of the wood industry. 
We will have a very significant effect on the forestry industry by creating multi species orchards with maximum profit.
 
In the years ahead, we desired to develop the soil tree project further. 
We will apply more expertise in automation and machine learning to a wider variety of tree species. 
Additionally, soil will be subjected to chemical analysis in order to collect accurate data on the soil's organic matter. 
As covid-19 issues contributed to the problem of famine, food production is crucial. 
We believe that the technology can be implemented in the field of crop recommendation in order to recommend the crops that produce the greatest quantity and quality of food for the population.
 
All in all, thank you.
